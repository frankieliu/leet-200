* order in two levels
105

* groupings and the operators
|   1 | op |  0 | op | 5 | -> eval(" ")
|     |    | 05 |    |   | -> eval(" ")
|  10 | op |  5 |    |   | -> eval(" ")
| 105 |    |    |    |   | -> eval(" ")

 *Note* can't considered 05 as a grouping

* tle with eval

* evaluate proactively
careful with precedence
a + b * c

@c, (a+b), send -5

undo (a+b) - b

combine b*c

undo the previous element
last element of recursion

* need to undo in a recursion

a + b * c * d

@d  you have a + b*c
    but you are actually passing (a + b*c, b*c)
    then undo a - b*c
    then multiply *d
    thed add it back a + (b*c*d)  pass (a+b*c*d, b*c*d)

the first argument is the subtotal, and the second is the last part
that was added (or substracted), just undo it with a

if you see a '*':
(arg[0] - arg[1] + arg[1] * next, arg[1] * next)

if you see a '+-':
(arg[0] + sign*next, sign*next)
