* 1106 parse a boolean expression

same as expression evaluation
use a value stack and an operator stack

iterate though the expression

if it's an operator, put onto operator stack
if it's (, push onto value stack
if it's value, convert to boolean and push to value stack
if it's ), pop operator
    if operator is !, invert the value, pop (, put value back in
    if opeator is |, set initial value to False, keep doing or, pop (, put back
    if opeator is &, set initial value to True, keep doing and, pop (, put back
   
return value left in stack
