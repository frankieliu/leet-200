41. Find the smallest missing positive

The bucket sort idea is ok, but you need to swap things around, so
I didn't like the idea.

There is another idea.

1. get rid of all numbers < 1 and > len(array), i.e.
   if nums[i] < 1 or nums[i] > len(array): nums[i] = 0

   this means that any left over numbers are between 1 and len(array)

2. this means that if you mod nums[i] by len(array)+1 it will be
   unaffected i.e.

   nums[i] % (len(array)+1) == nums[i]

3. like the bucket sort algorithm, we can then "add" this information to the correct bucket without affecting the bucket via:

   nums[nums[i] % k] += k

   where k is len(array)+1

   that is, we will add a count in multiples of k if we see that number in the
   array

4. Finally we get rid of the original number by dividing it out

   nums[i] = nums[i] // k

   that is, the original content is gone and I am only left with
   the information used in the bucket sort

5. Great no swapping and chasing things around.
   Recap:
   1. one loop to get rid of bad numbers
   2. one loop to bucket sort
   3. one loop to get rid of the original numbers and retain the
      bucket sort info, and find the smallest element

6. Thanks to @asones for this wonderful solution
