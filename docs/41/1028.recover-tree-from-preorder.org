* 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal

use a stack, the idea is that if level of a value is same as stack length, add it as child and push onto stack

1. for each new value, figure out its level

2. keep popping stack till stack height is same as this level

3. if parent does not have left child, add this new node as left child

4. otherwise add as right child

5. push new node onto stack
