* idea O(n)

1. put all elements in a set
   1. order and count don't matter
   2. offer O(1) look up for presence

2. iterate over all elements in the set

3. for each element:
   1. if it is the smallest in a contiguous sequence, then find how
      long the sequence is

4. figure if smallest is there is not a next smallest

5. note at most you revisit a number 3x:
   1. once when you are being looked up
   2. once when you are being checked by your neighbor
   3. once when you are being scanned for the longest sequence
